# Jittor AI Challenge, Track 2 — Point-Cloud Denoising & Classification

A solo entry to the 6th Jittor AI Challenge (3,668 registrations), implemented in [Jittor](https://github.com/Jittor/jittor): a reproduction of **StraightPCF** (CVPR 2024) for point-cloud denoising, and a **PCT** classifier for the qualification round.

**Technical report: [`report/tech_report.pdf`](report/tech_report.pdf)** — the method, the results, and what did not work. ([LaTeX source](report/tech_report.tex) · [中文说明](README.zh-CN.md) · [v1.0 release](https://github.com/Helios-YQH/jittor-competition-point-cloud/releases/tag/v1.0))

## Results

| Task | Model | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Point-cloud denoising | StraightPCF reproduction: two velocity modules, ≈0.47M parameters | **67.44/100** by the competition formula on a nine-mesh held-out split (CD sub-score 51.9, P2S sub-score 82.9); national top 100 of 3,668 registrations |
| Shape classification | PCT: 2 sample-and-group stages and 4 offset-attention blocks, ≈2.9M parameters | 12th in the warmup round; the round's pass mark was 80% test accuracy |

Pooled over the held-out samples, denoising cuts the Chamfer distance by 51% and the point-to-surface error by 67% against the noisy input. The paper reports higher accuracy on its own Gaussian-noise benchmarks, which are not comparable to this competition's Laplace noise; the report's post-mortem traces the points lost in the July rewrite chiefly to the switch in noise model.

The submitted pipeline and the code in this repository are not the same. The submission trained on the competition's own noisy clouds, with neither the coupling term nor the distance module; the July rewrite that added them, and switched to the paper's synthetic Gaussian noise, scored 2.65 points lower. Sections 3 and 6 of the report cover both.

## Quick start

Environment:

```bash
conda create -n jittor python=3.9 -y
conda activate jittor
conda install -c conda-forge gcc=10 gxx=10 libgomp -y
pip install jittor numpy trimesh scipy omegaconf matplotlib
pip install point-cloud-utils   # optional, for exact point-to-surface evaluation
```

Denoising, run from `denoise/`:

```bash
cd denoise

# Train, single GPU
python run.py --task configs/task/train_vm.yaml

# Train with MPI data parallelism
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3,4,5" mpirun -np 6 python run.py --task configs/task/train_vm.yaml

# Inference; set load_ckpt in the config first
python run.py --task configs/task/predict_vm.yaml

# Held-out self-evaluation
python self_eval.py --task configs/task/train_vm.yaml --split_ratio 0.1 --num_samples 10000
```

The paper's staged schedule has its own configs: `configs/task/train_vm_stage{1..4}.yaml`. A score-based variant in the style of ScoreDenoise is implemented in `src/model/score_vm.py`, with `train_score.yaml` and `predict_score.yaml`; it was never trained to a comparable state.

Classification, run from `warmup/`:

```bash
cd warmup
python train.py --data_dir ./data --epochs 300 --batch_size 32
```

## Data

Training meshes and pre-noised test clouds are provided by the competition organizers and are not included here. The code expects them under `denoise/dataset_train/` and `denoise/dataset_test_noisy/`, with split lists in `denoise/datalist/`; `denoise/README.md` documents the layout.
